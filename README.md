# Stroll
Cloud Project

Tourists who visit cities would like to visit the most popular destinations in a city be it a restaurant, coffee shop or recreational activities. However, they find themselves in a not-so satisfactory place at the end of the trip because they would have missed a few popular attractions in and around the city. We, sympathetic to the most ardent touristsâ€™ cause, decided to develop a mobile app to let tourists know the most frequently visited destinations in a particular city. While Google does provide all the popular destinations in a city, our app also provides the best time to visit a destination and also exposes the not-so popular, but authentic destinations in a locality.
